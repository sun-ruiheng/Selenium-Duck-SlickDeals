# Selenium-Duck-SlickDeals

Here, I tried using Selenium with Scrapy to crawl websites that rendered dynamically via JavaScript, making them impossible to scrape with solely Scrapy.

This project actually contains two different Spiders meant for two different websites: DuckDuckGo, used to test keying of input into fields, and Slickdeals, to test functionality when pagination is involved.

Path to DuckDuckGo Spider:
Selenium-Duck-SlickDeals > slickdeals > spiders > example.py

Path to Slickdeals Spider and JSON output:
Selenium-Duck-SlickDeals > slickdeals > spiders > computerdeals.py
Selenium-Duck-SlickDeals > computer_deals.json
